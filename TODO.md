## My personal TODO List

Ideas to think on:

* cross platform annotations (e.g. packed)
* simple functions
* embedded values (stuff into `.rodata`)
* destruction functions
* mini-heap garbage collection
* Representation transformers: take data designed in one way, expose functions to manipulate it in exactly that same way, but actually store it in another fashion. AoS to SoA for instance.
